                What is this ?  
            </h4>
            <p>
                This is a vite web app which use <a href="https://animejs.com/" target="_blank">anime.js</a> to animate car movements on your favorite race tracks all arround the world.
            </p>
            <h4>
                How to use it ?
            </h4>
            <p>
                On the <a href="/" data-route="/">home page</a> select a racing category (Like F1 or WEC), select a track on the card view then enjoy ! (You can pause the or reset car position)
            </p>
            <h4>
                Why this ?
            </h4>
            <p>
                After watching LeMans I remembered the Anime.js site, on the home page there was a very cool effect (with the track in 3d) and I thought “why not reproduce it”? Then finally I found that the RacingCircuit.info site was a bit boring.... If you're going to make a 3D circuit, why not make them all?

            <h4>
                1 - It will be updated with more tracks and features ?
            </h4>
            <p>
                All my plans are on the <a href="https://github.com/users/TheHyrox/projects/1/views/1" target="_blank">Project Backlog</a> on Github, you can see what I plan to do, what I do now and what is done.
            </p>
            <h4>
                2 - How you do the 3D ?
            </h4>
            <p>
                You fool ! It's not 3D, it's just a 2D SVG path with a perspective effect applied to it. You can see the code for it on the "tracks" named files and the RacingTrackVisualizer.js file.
            </p>
            <h4>
                3 - Can I contribute ? 
            </h4>
            <p>
                Of course ! You can contribute by adding new tracks and categories (please it could help me so much), fixing bugs (or only tell me your issues if you're not a dev) and even improving the design if you want. Simply go to the <a href="https://github.com/TheHyrox/RaceTrack/issues/new" target="_blank">issues page</a> on Github and create a new issue or a pull request.
